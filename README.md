# Shorty
Shorty is a simple URL shortening service. It uses a key-value store and has no user management itself but is built to integrate well into other services. Inspired from seeing microlinks (eg: kcd.im) used by [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) all over his blog.

## Built With
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)
